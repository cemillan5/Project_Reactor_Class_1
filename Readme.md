## Introduction To Functional Programming With Java

### What's Functional Programming?

**Functional programming** is a programming paradigm in which we try to
bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative
type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast
to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”. It uses expressions
instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a
statement is executed to assign variables.

## Why Functional Programming?

**Functional programming** is all about treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoiding
changing-state and mutable data. So, why should Java developers consider this paradigm?

- **Concise and Expressive Code**: Functional programming promotes shorter, more concise code, making it easier to
  understand and maintain. This can lead to increased productivity and fewer bugs.
- **Immutable Data**: It encourages immutability, which means once data is created, it cannot be changed. This can
  improve code reliability and make it easier to reason about.
- **Parallel and Concurrent Programming**: Functional programming is an excellent fit for parallel and concurrent
  programming, where tasks are executed simultaneously, and shared data is managed safely.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Java’s support for higher-order functions is quite powerful. It allows you to pass functions
  as arguments and return functions from other functions.
- **Declarative Approach**: You describe what your code should achieve, rather than listing the steps to achieve it.
  This leads to more expressive and less error-prone code.
- **Java’s Lambda Expressions**: With the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8, functional programming in Java
  became much more practical and accessible. You can define and use functions more concisely than ever before.

## Basic Concepts

1. Higher-Order Functions

**Higher-order functions are capable of receiving functions as arguments and returning a function as a result.**
